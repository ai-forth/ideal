## The ideal initiative (Number One)

As I have been working toward understanding the placement of this process since discovering it in late 2014 and with the collection of test equipment as well as the myriad _6x09_ prototypes and the verse of forth, it is now time to set into formal writing what it means to _ai-compute_.

### Research and Development Paradigm

_The scope and implementation of ideal_

In the days of the predominance of the von Neumann architecture and within the writings of Turing, one discovers the contrast of paradigms between precise and imprecise computation within a simulated machine called the electronic computer. Applications designed to perform a plethora of activities and objectives exist at a level of abstraction relative to hardware where knowledge of how the architecture is actually leveraged is an obscure approximation embedded into a language compiler. The rise of software-controlled robots clearly demarcated the need for algorithms that steered the systemâ€™s behavior toward an ideal condition that is contrasted with those dynamic elements in its environment. Of these, those tending toward a robotic self-independence discovered that a principle of reward and penalty mitigated the complexity of the functions tending toward the imprecise to return to a more precise state.
