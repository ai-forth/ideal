## ideal-forth-target

The code is this repo is targeted to be _transmuted_ into the beautiful Forth language so that Ideal can be what its namesake implies.

### What is here

* Details regarding a formalization "initiative" is found [here](/initiative/README.md)
* Project notes diary is found [here](/ProjectNotes.txt)

### Current status

Branch-04 from the cartheur/ideal repo is contained herein. This means that the program will practise self-learning. It is clearly demonstrated when running this application and getting the error:

`Unhandled exception. System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException: The given key '<e2r1e2r2>' was not present in the dictionary.`

Subsequent to the program wanting to shift itself away from the previous sequence:

```
propose e2 proclivity 0
propose e2 proclivity 0
Enacted e2r1 valence -1 weight 0
0: Pained
propose e2 proclivity 0
propose e2 proclivity 0
Enacted e2r2 valence 1 weight 0
```
Where it is enacting "positive" change. The meaning of the new label and a pathway for new labels to be added is the obvious pathway forward; however, as this program can find practical use in cartheur-david, particularly the _joi_ bipedal robot, it is becoming priority to assign realworld meaning to labels generated by this program.
